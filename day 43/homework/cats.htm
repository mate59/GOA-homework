            Cats are fascinating animals with a mix of independence, curiosity, and affection. Here’s a clear, friendly overview: <br> <br>

            🐾 Basic Facts <br>

            Species: Felis catus (domestic cat) <br>

            Lifespan: Typically 12–18 years, sometimes over 20 <br>

            Size: Most weigh 3–6 kg (7–13 lbs) <br>

            Diet: Obligate carnivores—need meat-based nutrients like taurine <br><br>

            😺 Behavior & Personality <br>

            Independent but social: Cats enjoy companionship but like to control when and how they interact. <br>

            Territorial: They mark spaces with scent glands on their cheeks, paws, and tail base. <br>

            Playful hunters: Even indoor cats instinctively stalk, pounce, and chase. <br>

            Vocal communication: Meowing is mostly for humans—cats rarely meow to each other as adults. <br><br>

            🧠 Intelligence <br>

            They can solve puzzles, learn routines, understand tone, and recognize their name (even if they pretend not to). <br>

            Their memories are strong, especially for positive and negative experiences. <br> <br>

            🛏️ Lifestyle <br>

            Sleep: 12–16 hours/day—natural crepuscular hunters (most active at dawn/dusk). <br>

            Grooming: Spend up to 30–50% of waking hours cleaning themselves. <br> <br>
