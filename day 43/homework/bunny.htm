            🐰 Basic Facts<br>

            Species: Oryctolagus cuniculus (domestic rabbit)<br>

            Lifespan: 8–12 years (some live longer with proper care)<br>

            Size: Varies widely by breed—1 kg (2 lbs) for dwarfs up to 10+ kg (22 lbs) for giant breeds<br>

            Diet: Herbivores—require mostly hay, plus leafy greens and small portions of pellets<br> <br>

            🌿 Behavior & Personality<br>

            Social animals: Prefer  living with another rabbit (bonded pairs) when possible.<br>

            Gentle but sensitive: Can get stressed easily; need a calm environment.<br>

            Very expressive: Use body language—thumps, binkies (joy jumps), chin rubbing, and ear positions.<br>

            Crepuscular: Most active at dawn and dusk, similar to cats in that way.<br> <br>

            🧠 Intelligence<br>

            Can be litter-trained<br>

            Learn tricks (come, spin, jump obstacles)<br>

            Recognize human voices and routines<br>

            Need daily mental enrichment to prevent boredom<br> <br>

            🏠 Care Requirements<br>

            Space: Even small rabbits need room to run; cages alone are not enough.<br>

            Chewing: Natural behavior—provide safe chew toys, or your furniture may suffer!<br>

            Grooming: Some breeds (long-haired) need regular brushing.<br>

            Health: Require a rabbit-savvy vet; common issues include dental problems and digestive stasis.<br> <br>

            ❤️ Why People Love Bunnies<br>

            Quiet, gentle companions<br>

            Playful and quirky personalities<br>

            Can form strong bonds with humans<br>

            Adorable expressions and behaviors (binkies, flops, nudges)<br> <br>

            🐇 Fun Facts<br>

            A rabbit’s teeth never stop growing—they need hay to keep them worn down.<br>

            Rabbits can see almost 360 degrees, but have a blind spot right in front of their nose.<br>

            They communicate with their feet—thumping as a warning signal.<br>

            A happy rabbit may “flop” dramatically onto its side, which looks alarming but means total relaxation.<br>
